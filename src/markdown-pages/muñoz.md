Darío Echeverría Muñoz is a dedicated Ecuadorian lawyer with a passion for leveraging technology to shape the future of law. He holds a specialization and master’s degree in financial, Securities, and Insurance Law, as well as an LL.M. in International Business Law. Currently, he is completing his master’s degree in digital economy law.

His expertise lies in the intersection of law and technology, particularly in the areas of blockchain, crypto assets, artificial intelligence, and data protection. He has actively shared his knowledge through speaking at international conferences, publishing articles, and mentoring students.
As a Fellow during the 7th Kleros Fellowship batch, Darío undertook the research project titled "Implementation of Kleros in Tokenized Stock Dispute Resolution." This innovative study explored the potential of blockchain-based decentralized justice to address the unique challenges of resolving disputes related to tokenized shares in Ecuador.

Darío's research aligns with Ecuador's 2020 Law of Modernization of the Companies Law, which enables the issuance of dematerialized shares and paves the way for share tokenization. By analyzing the integration of Kleros into Ecuador's legal framework, Darío's work contributes to the development of a robust legal infrastructure for the digital asset economy.
