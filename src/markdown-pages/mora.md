Mora Tapia Gómez is a licensed lawyer registered with the Buenos Aires City Bar Association (Argentina). She earned her law degree from Universidad de San Andrés and later obtained a Master's in Public Policy (MPP) from Universidad Torcuato Di Tella. Throughout her academic and professional journey, she combined her studies with diverse legal experiences.

She worked for several years at a Federal Criminal Court in Buenos Aires, where she gained in-depth knowledge of the functioning of the justice system and participated in high-complexity cases. Mora currently works at a leading law firm, focusing on compliance, litigation, and regulatory matters.

With a strong interest in technology, conflict resolution, transparency, and access to justice, Mora was naturally drawn to Kleros' decentralized arbitration system and its potential to innovate traditional dispute resolution mechanisms.
