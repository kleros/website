Florencia Brusco is a lawyer whose work bridges the fields of international law and blockchain innovation. Graduated with honours from the University of Buenos Aires and holding an LL.M. with honours in Global Criminal Law from the University of Groningen, she combines a strong academic foundation with a career that spans from traditional courts to decentralised finance.

With more than eight years of experience between national and international courts of law, she has developed deep knowledge of procedural law and cross-border legal frameworks. Building on this foundation, she now works for a leading DeFi project in the Ethereum ecosystem, where she addresses complex regulatory and legal challenges in a fast-evolving technological landscape.

As a Fellow in the 7th Kleros Fellowship, in her report From Blockchain to Bench: Evaluating the Kleros Pilot in Mendoza's Judicial System, she analyses a pioneering collaboration between the Judiciary of Mendoza, Argentina, and the decentralised justice protocol Kleros. This reflects her broader commitment to connecting established legal systems with the transformative potential of blockchain innovation. Her report is available in English and Spanish.
