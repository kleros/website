Abeer Sharma is an Indian dispute resolution lawyer and legal researcher with a multidisciplinary professional interest spanning across public policy, jurisprudence, energy law and international arbitration.

He is highly optimistic about the potential for new technologies to disrupt the contemporary regulatory framework and the theory and practice of law, and is an avid supporter of reformation to bring the existing legal regime up to date with the 21st century.

During the Fellowship, Abeer will conduct research on the potential of Kleros as an arbitration method for long term contracts, in particular, within the oil and gas industry.
