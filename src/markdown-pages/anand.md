Parul Anand is an undergraduate law student who is interested in the intersection of technology, law, policy and society. Currently, she is exploring AI, ethics and policy – while she has been previously engaged with Blockchain, law, and policy. Her experience includes several internships and research projects in these fields. Apart from that, she is also a certified Yoga teacher and an aspiring mural artist.

Her research investigates the intersections of blockchain, AI, law, and policy, specifically examining whether decentralized justice — using Kleros’ blockchain-based arbitration platform — could address intellectual property rights (IPR) disputes in generative AI. Using AI-generated art as a case study, her work examines the potential of integrating blockchain-based digital rights frameworks with Kleros' arbitration system as a novel solution for IPR conflicts in AI-generated content.
