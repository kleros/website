Guenter Schramm Tronca is a licensed lawyer registered with the Málaga Bar Association in Spain.

He studied law at the Catholic University of Córdoba, Argentina, and later earned both a Law Degree and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) from the University of Málaga. Throughout his academic journey, he combined his studies with various professional experiences.

A strong enthusiast of blockchain technology since 2018, he first delved into the field by completing Federico Ast’s Coursera course “The Disruption of Blockchain.” He has practiced law in three different countries—Argentina, Spain, and Germany—working at various law firms such as Toscanolex Legal Boutique (his current firm), Martínez-Echevarría, and SGP Schneider Geiwitz, among others.

In addition to his private-sector experience, he has worked in several areas of public administration, including the Consumer Protection for the Government of Córdoba (Argentina), the Office for Women and Gender Violence for the Government of Córdoba (Argentina), and the Consumer Arbitration Board for the Provincial Council of Málaga (Spain).

Thanks to his extensive international legal experience and his fluency in English, Spanish, and German, he has, in recent years, specialized in urban planning and real estate law, with a focus on both national and international real estate transactions.
