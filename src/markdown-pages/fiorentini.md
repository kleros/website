Maria Fiorentini is an Argentinian law student with expertise in technology, mostly Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. She is part of Mujeres en Crypto Core Team and co-founder of Mujeres en Derecho. She is also certified as Legal Project Manager.

Her  research focuses on integrating a precedent system into Kleros to improve its effectiveness and reliability as a decentralized justice platform. The study outlines two key milestones: (i) establishing the importance of precedents, and (ii) designing Klerosâ€™ precedent system. Through comparative analysis of established legal tools like LexisNexis Shepard and Westlaw, it identifies essential features for Kleros, including advanced search, AI classification, cross-referencing, and predictive analytics. Emphasizing the need for transparency and democratized access, the paper highlights how a robust precedent system could guide jurors, enhance consistency in rulings, and elevate Kleros' operational efficiency in decentralized justice.
