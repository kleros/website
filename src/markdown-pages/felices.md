Jose Miguel Martínez Felices is a researcher passionate about scientific integrity and innovative dispute resolution mechanisms.

As a Fellow in the 7th Kleros Fellowship of Justice, he authored the paper "Dispute Resolution in the Context of Scientific Retraction," which explores how decentralized justice can address the lack of transparency and fairness in the scientific retraction process—particularly in cases of alleged plagiarism.

Jose Miguel proposes a novel framework using Kleros Courts to adjudicate retraction disputes. His model introduces blockchain-based arbitration with transparent procedures, expert jurors, and incentive-driven decision-making. By applying this approach, his work aims to protect researchers' rights and establish a more consistent, efficient standard for resolving disputes in academic publishing.
