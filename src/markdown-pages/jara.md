José María de la Jara is an arbitration attorney with the heart of a behavioral designer. He holds a JD from Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú and is currently finishing an LLM at Columbia Law School. José María acted as a Training Coordinator at the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative, and worked for 8 years as an Arbitration Associate at Bullard Falla Ezcurra +.
